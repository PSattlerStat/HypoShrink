Description: A collection of functions to compute so-called companion
    hypotheses for given linear hypotheses. Companion hypotheses yield the
    same test statistic values and test decisions for commonly used
    quadratic-form-based procedures, including the Wald-type statistic
    (WTS), the modified ANOVA-type statistic (MATS), and variants of the
    ANOVA-type statistic (ATS), while using a minimal number of rows. This
    reduction can substantially decrease computational effort. Companion
    hypotheses can be obtained numerically or, in the case of the centering
    matrix, via an explicit formula. For methodological details, see
    Sattler and Rosenbaum (2025).
