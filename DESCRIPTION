Description: A compilation of functions to obtain the so-called companion 
    hypothesis for a given linear hypothesis. This companion hypothesis leads to 
    the same value and test decision for commonly used quadratic form-based test 
    statistics (WTS, MATS, and versions of the ATS), but with a minimal number
    of rows. This reduces computational effort. The companion hypothesis can be 
    generated numerically or, for the centering matrix, through an explicit 
    formula. For more details on the methodology, see
    Sattler and Rosenbaum (2025) <doi:10.1016/j.spl.2025.110356> and
    Sattler and Stegherr (2025) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2310.11799>.
