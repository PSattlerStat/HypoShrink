\title{Evaluate Relative Time Savings from Companion Hypothesis Matrices}
\usage{
HypothesisPotential(H, duration = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{H}{A hypothesis matrix. Must \strong{not} have full row rank.}

\item{duration}{Minimum time (in seconds) that each benchmark comparison
should run, with defaults setting are 10 seconds. which should not be
undercut, and  even set higher for more reliable results.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the relative time savings (in percent) for
each method.
}
\description{
This function compares the computational efficiency of test statistics
(\code{ATS}, \code{ATS_s}, \code{ATS_f}, and \code{WTS}) when using a companion hypothesis
matrix instead of the original hypothesis matrix \code{H}.
}
\details{
The function uses the \code{bench} package to benchmark computation
times for test statistics when using the original hypothesis matrix \code{H}
versus its reduced-rank companion matrix.
}
\examples{
# Example usage (requires functions like ATS, ATS_s, etc., to be defined):
# H <- matrix(c(1, 0, 1, 1), nrow = 2)
# HypothesisPotential2(H, duration = 5)
