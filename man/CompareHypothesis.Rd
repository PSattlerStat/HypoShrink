\title{Compare Two Hypothesis Representations in Linear Models}
\usage{
CompareHypothesis(H1, H2, y1 = NULL, y2 = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{H1}{A numeric matrix representing the first hypothesis contrast matrix.}

\item{H2}{A numeric matrix representing the second hypothesis contrast matrix.}

\item{y1}{An optional numeric vector representing the right-hand side for the first hypothesis. Defaults to a zero vector.}

\item{y2}{An optional numeric vector representing the right-hand side for the second hypothesis. Defaults to a zero vector.}
}
\value{
A character string indicating the level of agreement between the two representations:
\itemize{
\item \code{"all_equal"}: All ATS versions (classical and standardized) agree.
\item \code{"standardized_equal"}: Only the standardized ATS versions agree; the classical version differs.
\item \code{"none_equal"}: No ATS versions agree between the two representations.
}
A message is also printed to inform the user.
}
\description{
This function compares two hypothesis representations (i.e., contrast matrices and corresponding right-hand sides) used in linear models or ANOVA frameworks.
It checks whether the classical and standardized ATS (Approximate Test Statistic) versions agree between the two representations.
}
\examples{
H <- matrix(c(1, 0, 0, 1), nrow = 2)
CompareHypothesis(H, H)  # Should return "all_equal"
